## upenn.cbica.captk.example3

Example plugin targeted to developers to demonstrate usage / guidelines.

This plugin demonstrates how we can split out the functionality into a module, which does the "heavy lifting". This is useful for making the algorithmic parts of your code into reusable form and leaves the plugin as the graphical interface to the module.
